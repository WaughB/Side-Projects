# Side-Projects
Some are done in both C and C++. This is based on availibilty of time. I find
it good practice to code the same thing in multiple languages, preference. Many
of these projects are heavily relied on from "C Programming A ModernApproach" by
K. N. King.

[Black Jack](Black_jack.cpp): Inspired after programming a game of Craps for an assignment.
	Popular card game, also referred to as 21.
	
[Fahrenheit Converter](Fahrenheit_Converter.c): Inspired after developing similar programs for
	COP3514 and COP2931. Converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius. [Also available in C++](Fahrenheit_Converter.cpp).
	
[UPC Authenticator](UPC_Authenticator.c): Checks to see if a twelve digit barcode will be valid. 
	United Stated standard. [Also available in C++](UPC_Authenticator.cpp)
	
[EAN Authenticator](EAN_Authenticator.c): Checks to see if a thirteen digit barcode will be valid.
	European standard. [Also available in C++](EAN_Authenticator.cpp).
	
[Broker Commission](Broker_Commission.c): Calculates the amount a broker would receive on a trade,
	using some standard amounts. [Also available in C++(Broker_Commission.cpp).
	
[Legal Date Formatter](Legal_Date_Formatter.c): Converts the usual mm/dd/yyyy format to a legal format
	that is typically used at the top of legal documents. [Also available in C++](Legal_Date_Formatter.cpp).
	
[Checkbook Balancer](Checkbook_Balancer.c): Gives the User an option to clear, credit, or debit to
	make checkbook balancing easier. [Also available in C++](Checkbook_Balancer.cpp).
	
[CPI Calculator](CPI_Calculator.c): Takes an amount of money (USD) from one year and converts it
	into another year. Dates are from 1913 to 2016. Based on the CPI data from
	the BLS. [Also available in C++](CPI_Calculator.cpp)
	
[Employment and Labor](Employment_and_Labor.cpp): Based on User inputted values, can calculate the
	Unemployment Rate, Labor Force Participation Rate, and the Employment
	Population Ratio.
	
[Difference in Purchasing Power](Difference_in_Purchasing_Power.c): Taking two salaries and Consumer Price
	Indexes (CPIs) from the User, the program determines which area would give
	more purchasing power. [Also available in C++](Difference_in_Purchasing_Power.cpp)
	
[Total Increase in the Money Supply](Total_Increase_in_the_Money_Supply.cpp): Program will calculate how much money a 
	bank receives when a person deposits money in it. Using the simple deposit 
	multiplier, which assumes all funds deposited in the bank and banks 
	lending out all excess reserves.
